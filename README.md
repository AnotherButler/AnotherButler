## Knowledge sharing, good company and Jane Austen

In Jane Austenâ€™s Persuasion, Anne Elliott says, "My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company." This definition of good company speaks to me, so I invite you to add me as a connection [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandasgbutler) and to exchange thoughts and information.
