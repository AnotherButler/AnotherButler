## Knowledge sharing, good company and Jane Austen

In Jane Austen’s Persuasion, Anne Elliott says, "My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company." This definition of good company speaks to me, so I invite you to add me as a connection [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandasgbutler) and to exchange thoughts and information. I'm always interested in exchanging tech writing tips, discussing documentation processes, and learning about new industry trends. 

## More about me

As a lead technical writer of customer-facing content, I am a hard worker who thrives on contributing to a great team atmosphere. I specialize in managing globally distributed teams of technical writers. I'm passionate about bringing new faces into the industry and helping people in the industry grow in their careers, which is why I co-authored the [Technical Writing Process (2nd ed)](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Writing-Process-Timeless-Techniques/dp/0994169329).

Currently, I manage a remote team of international writers and lead documentation strategy for software products. I am knowledgeable about physics, biology, and engineering, and I love to learn new subjects. I graduated from the University of Missouri with one degree in physics and one in magazine journalism. Something to know about me is I'm a morning person who likes to stay busy.
